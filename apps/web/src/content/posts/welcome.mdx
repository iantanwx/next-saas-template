This is our first blog post using the new MDX system. We've migrated from Contentlayer to next-mdx-remote for a simpler and more maintainable solution.

## What's New?

- Simpler setup with next-mdx-remote
- Direct MDX file handling
- Better performance
- Easier to maintain

## Code Example

```tsx
function HelloWorld() {
  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
}
```

## Next Steps

We'll be adding more posts and features to our blog soon. Stay tuned!
