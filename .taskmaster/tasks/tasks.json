PGlite is a lightweight PostgreSQL implementation that runs in the browser and provides full PostgreSQL features while maintaining compatibility with Electric SQL. The setup should initialize PGlite in a dedicated web worker to avoid blocking the main thread and improve performance. This includes configuring the web worker communication layer, setting up the PGlite instance with appropriate memory limits, and establishing the Electric SQL client connection through the worker interface. The database schema should leverage PostgreSQL-specific features that PGlite supports, such as JSON columns and advanced indexing capabilities.\n</info added on 2025-08-05T08:40:05.149Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-09T02:12:36.413Z>\nSince we're now migrating to Rocicorp Zero instead of Electric SQL/PGlite, this subtask needs to be completely reoriented. The new focus should be on setting up Zero's local storage system which uses a fundamentally different architecture. Zero provides its own local storage layer that doesn't require manual SQLite or PGlite configuration. Instead, we need to install the @rocicorp/zero package, initialize the Zero client with appropriate server configuration, define data schemas using Zero's schema definition system, set up the local cache storage that Zero manages automatically, and configure the initial sync settings. Zero handles the local storage internally using IndexedDB in browsers, so we don't need to manage database files directly. The setup involves creating Zero mutators for data operations, defining the initial data model schemas, configuring the Zero server connection settings, and initializing the Zero client in the application bootstrap process.\n</info added on 2025-08-09T02:12:36.413Z>",
