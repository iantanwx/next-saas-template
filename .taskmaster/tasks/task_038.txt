# Task ID: 38
# Title: Implement Error Recovery for Workflows
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create robust error recovery mechanisms for workflows to handle failures gracefully.
# Details:
1. Implement step-level error handling
2. Create workflow-level error policies
3. Add retry mechanisms with backoff
4. Implement checkpoint-based recovery
5. Create manual intervention UI for errors
6. Add error notification system
7. Implement partial results saving
8. Create error analytics and reporting

# Test Strategy:
1. Test error handling at step and workflow levels
2. Verify retry mechanisms work correctly
3. Test checkpoint-based recovery after failures
4. Ensure manual intervention UI works properly
5. Validate error notifications and reporting
