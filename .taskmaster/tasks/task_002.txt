# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Local-First Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a local-first architecture that allows the application to work offline with seamless synchronization.
# Details:
1. Set up local SQLite database with Electric SQL
2. Create data access layer that prioritizes local data
3. Implement optimistic UI updates
4. Design sync conflict detection mechanism
5. Create data models with appropriate timestamps for sync
6. Implement background sync process
7. Add network status detection
8. Create fallback mechanisms for when server is unreachable

# Test Strategy:
1. Test application functionality while offline
2. Verify data synchronizes correctly when connection is restored
3. Simulate network interruptions to ensure resilience
4. Validate that local changes are preserved during sync
5. Measure performance impact of local-first approach

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up local SQLite database with Electric SQL [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize and configure a local SQLite database using Electric SQL to enable offline data storage and synchronization capabilities.
### Details:
Install Electric SQL dependencies and configure the client. Set up the SQLite database schema with appropriate tables for the application data. Define the necessary migrations for the database structure. Configure Electric SQL with the appropriate connection settings for both local development and production environments. Initialize the database connection in the application startup process.

## 2. Configure tRPC split link architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement a tRPC split link configuration that supports both WebSocket connections for subscriptions and HTTP connections for queries and mutations.
### Details:
Create a tRPC WebSocket link that connects to the CloudFlare Worker for real-time subscriptions. Implement an HTTP link for queries and mutations that connects to Next.js API routes. Configure a split link that routes subscription operations to the WebSocket link and other operations to the HTTP link. Add error handling and reconnection logic for both links. Implement request batching for the HTTP link to optimize performance.

## 3. Implement data access layer with local-first priority [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Create a data access layer that prioritizes local data access while handling synchronization with the server when online.
### Details:
Develop a data access abstraction that first attempts to retrieve and manipulate data locally. Implement methods for CRUD operations that work with the local SQLite database. Create a synchronization mechanism that pushes local changes to the server when online. Implement data fetching strategies that prioritize local data but update from the server when available. Add caching mechanisms to optimize data access performance.

## 4. Design and implement shape-based subscriptions [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Create a subscription system based on data shapes, with one subscription per data type to efficiently manage real-time updates.
### Details:
Define subscription shapes for each major data type in the application. Implement subscription handlers that process incoming data changes. Create client-side subscription management that efficiently subscribes and unsubscribes based on active views. Implement data normalization to handle overlapping subscriptions. Add subscription throttling and batching to prevent overwhelming the client with updates.

## 5. Implement optimistic UI updates and offline queue [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Create a system for optimistic UI updates that immediately reflects user actions while queueing operations for synchronization when offline.
### Details:
Implement optimistic updates that immediately update the UI when actions are performed. Create an offline queue that stores operations when the application is offline. Develop a queue processing mechanism that executes queued operations when connectivity is restored. Add transaction support to ensure operations are atomic. Implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations to maintain data consistency.

## 6. Implement network status detection and fallback mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.5
### Description: Add network status detection to the application and implement fallback mechanisms for when the server is unreachable.
### Details:
Implement network status detection using browser APIs and heartbeat mechanisms. Create a network status store that provides the current connectivity state to the application. Develop fallback mechanisms that gracefully handle server unavailability. Implement retry strategies with exponential backoff for failed requests. Add user notifications for connectivity changes to improve the user experience.

## 7. Implement sync conflict detection and resolution [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.5, 2.6
### Description: Design and implement mechanisms for detecting and resolving conflicts that occur during data synchronization.
### Details:
Implement timestamp-based conflict detection using last-modified timestamps. Create data models with appropriate timestamp fields for tracking changes. Develop conflict resolution strategies based on application-specific rules (e.g., last-write-wins, manual resolution). Implement a conflict resolution UI for cases requiring user intervention. Add logging and analytics for conflict occurrences to identify patterns and improve resolution strategies.
