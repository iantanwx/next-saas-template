# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Local-First Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a local-first architecture that allows the application to work offline with seamless synchronization using Rocicorp Zero as the sync engine.
# Details:
1. Set up Rocicorp Zero client with local storage
2. Create data access layer that prioritizes local data
3. Implement optimistic UI updates with Zero's mutation system
4. Design sync conflict detection using Zero's conflict resolution
5. Create data models compatible with Zero's schema system
6. Implement background sync process using Zero's sync engine
7. Add network status detection
8. Create fallback mechanisms for when server is unreachable

# Test Strategy:
1. Test application functionality while offline
2. Verify data synchronizes correctly when connection is restored using Zero
3. Simulate network interruptions to ensure resilience
4. Validate that local changes are preserved during sync
5. Measure performance impact of local-first approach with Zero
6. Test Zero's conflict resolution mechanisms

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up local SQLite database with Electric SQL [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize and configure a local SQLite database using Electric SQL to enable offline data storage and synchronization capabilities.
### Details:
Install Electric SQL dependencies and configure the client. Set up the SQLite database schema with appropriate tables for the application data. Define the necessary migrations for the database structure. Configure Electric SQL with the appropriate connection settings for both local development and production environments. Initialize the database connection in the application startup process.

Updated to use PGlite instead of SQLite for better PostgreSQL compatibility. PGlite is a lightweight PostgreSQL implementation that runs in the browser and provides full PostgreSQL features while maintaining compatibility with Electric SQL. The setup should initialize PGlite in a dedicated web worker to avoid blocking the main thread and improve performance. This includes configuring the web worker communication layer, setting up the PGlite instance with appropriate memory limits, and establishing the Electric SQL client connection through the worker interface. The database schema should leverage PostgreSQL-specific features that PGlite supports, such as JSON columns and advanced indexing capabilities.

## 2. Migrate from Electric SQL to Rocicorp Zero [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Replace the existing PGlite/Electric SQL setup with Rocicorp Zero for local-first synchronization.
### Details:
Install Rocicorp Zero client dependencies. Configure Zero client with appropriate server connection settings. Migrate existing data models to Zero's schema format. Set up Zero's local storage system to replace PGlite. Initialize Zero client in the application with proper authentication and sync configuration. Remove Electric SQL and PGlite dependencies and related worker setup. Update existing data access patterns to use Zero's API instead of direct SQL queries.

## 3. Configure tRPC split link architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a tRPC split link configuration that supports both WebSocket connections for subscriptions and HTTP connections for queries and mutations.
### Details:
Create a tRPC WebSocket link that connects to the CloudFlare Worker for real-time subscriptions. Implement an HTTP link for queries and mutations that connects to Next.js API routes. Configure a split link that routes subscription operations to the WebSocket link and other operations to the HTTP link. Add error handling and reconnection logic for both links. Implement request batching for the HTTP link to optimize performance.

## 4. Implement data access layer with Zero's local-first priority [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create a data access layer that uses Zero's built-in local-first capabilities for data operations.
### Details:
Develop a data access abstraction that leverages Zero's local-first architecture. Implement methods for CRUD operations using Zero's query and mutation APIs. Utilize Zero's automatic synchronization mechanisms for server updates. Create query hooks that work with Zero's reactive data system. Implement Zero's subscription system for real-time updates. Add caching strategies that complement Zero's built-in local storage.

## 5. Design and implement Zero-based subscriptions [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.4
### Description: Utilize Zero's built-in subscription system for real-time data updates.
### Details:
Configure Zero's subscription system for real-time data updates. Implement subscription queries using Zero's query API. Create client-side subscription management that integrates with Zero's reactive system. Utilize Zero's built-in data normalization and caching. Implement subscription filtering and optimization using Zero's query capabilities. Ensure subscriptions work seamlessly with Zero's offline-first approach.

## 6. Implement optimistic UI updates using Zero's mutation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Leverage Zero's built-in optimistic updates and mutation system for immediate UI feedback.
### Details:
Implement optimistic updates using Zero's mutation system that provides automatic rollback capabilities. Utilize Zero's built-in offline queue for mutations when disconnected. Configure Zero's conflict resolution strategies for concurrent modifications. Implement custom mutation logic where needed using Zero's mutation API. Leverage Zero's automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations. Add custom error handling for mutations that complement Zero's built-in error handling.

## 7. Implement network status detection with Zero integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4, 2.6
### Description: Add network status detection that works seamlessly with Zero's sync engine and connection management.
### Details:
Implement network status detection that integrates with Zero's connection state. Utilize Zero's built-in sync status indicators for user feedback. Create a network status store that combines browser APIs with Zero's connection information. Implement user notifications that leverage Zero's sync state changes. Add retry strategies that complement Zero's built-in retry mechanisms. Ensure network status UI reflects Zero's actual sync state.

## 8. Configure Zero's conflict resolution system [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4, 2.6, 2.7
### Description: Set up and customize Zero's built-in conflict detection and resolution mechanisms.
### Details:
Configure Zero's conflict resolution strategies based on application requirements. Implement custom conflict resolution handlers where Zero's built-in strategies are insufficient. Set up conflict logging and monitoring using Zero's conflict detection system. Create user interfaces for manual conflict resolution when needed. Implement conflict resolution rules that work with Zero's operational transform system. Add analytics for conflict patterns using Zero's conflict metadata.
