# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Workflow State Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a system for persisting workflow state to enable resumption after interruptions or failures.
# Details:
1. Design workflow state storage model
2. Implement state serialization and deserialization
3. Create state checkpoint mechanism
4. Implement state restoration on workflow resumption
5. Add versioning for state schema changes
6. Create state cleanup for completed workflows
7. Implement state compression for large datasets
8. Add state encryption for sensitive data

# Test Strategy:
1. Test state persistence through server restarts
2. Verify state restoration works correctly
3. Test handling of state schema changes
4. Ensure state cleanup prevents data leaks
5. Validate performance with large state objects
