# Product Requirements Document

## Next.js SaaS Template - Personal Development Edition

**Document Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Personal use for rapid SaaS development

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the development roadmap for enhancing the existing Next.js SaaS template into a comprehensive toolkit for building real-time, workflow-driven SaaS applications. The focus is on enabling rapid development of sophisticated applications with long-running workflows, offline support, and real-time collaboration.

### Current State

- Modern tech stack with Next.js 15, Supabase, tRPC
- Basic authentication (Google OAuth only)
- Basic organization-based multi-tenancy with email invitations
- No payment processing
- Basic monitoring with Sentry and Axiom
- Slack integration

### Target State

A complete SaaS development toolkit optimized for real-time, long-running workflows (data processing, AI agents, automation) that enables launching sophisticated SaaS products in days rather than weeks. Deployment is streamlined through Vercel for web/serverless and Render for workers.

## Objectives and Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. Build sophisticated workflow-driven SaaS in days, not months
2. Enable real-time, collaborative experiences by default
3. Support long-running processes reliably
4. Work offline-first with seamless sync
5. Eliminate complex state management code

### Success Criteria

- Launch a workflow-enabled SaaS MVP in under 7 days (after template completion)
- Support workflows running for hours/days without failure
- Real-time updates with < 100ms local latency
- 100% functionality available offline
- Zero data conflicts in multi-user scenarios
- Each major system thoroughly tested and documented
- Clean abstractions that make customization straightforward

### Non-Goals

- Extensive documentation for external users
- Multi-framework support
- Community building features
- Marketing materials
- Video tutorials
- Support for legacy browsers

| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework       | Next.js 15            | Latest features, app router, React Server Components          |
| Database        | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Real-time capabilities, auth included, generous free tier     |
| Real-time Sync  | Electric SQL          | Local-first, offline support, automatic conflict resolution   |
| Type Safety     | tRPC                  | End-to-end type safety without code generation                |
| Workflow Engine | Inngest               | Serverless-first, deep Next.js integration, simple deployment |
| Email           | Resend                | Modern API, developer-friendly, good deliverability           |
| Payments        | Stripe                | Industry standard, best documentation, reliable               |
| Monitoring      | Sentry + Axiom        | Comprehensive error tracking and logging                      |

### Architectural Principles

1. **Local-First Real-time**: All data operations work offline with automatic sync
2. **Workflow Resilience**: Long-running processes survive server restarts and failures
3. **Event-Driven**: Loosely coupled components communicate through events
4. **Type Safety First**: End-to-end type safety from database to UI
5. **Edge Compatible**: Stateless operations can run on edge infrastructure
6. **Observable Systems**: Every operation is traceable and monitorable
